# lukeR

R package for Luke-related database-wrappers, color-themes and templates.


## Installation 
To install this, first install packages 

* `remotes`
* `XML`
* `rsvg`

e.g. `install.packages(c("remotes", "XML", "rsvg"))` . Then run inside R one of

```r
remotes::install_github("antiphon/lukeR")
# or with some examples
remotes::install_github("antiphon/lukeR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
If you are connected to Reitti, you might need to adjust your proxy-settings to be able to
install directly from Github. This can be done by adding the line

```
Sys.setenv(https_proxy="http://*secret goverment proxy here*")
```

into your `.Rprofile`  (e.g. using `usethis::edit_r_profile()`)

At the moment you need to ask the proxy address details from e.g. Teams channel "Luke R users" (see wiki therein).
